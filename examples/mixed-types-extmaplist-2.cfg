// Sample server config #2 for using the new "sv_extmaplist" cvar
// This is not your entire server.cfg, only the part that is relevant
// to running mixed gametypes. You should copy and paste this to the end
// of your server.cfg.


// These cvars control the settings for each gametype. For a detailed explanation
// see the "mixed-types-extmaplist_1.cfg" file and also the readme file.
//
set g_mef_settings "timelimit: 30 fraglimit: 5"
set g_ffa_settings "fraglimit: 50"
set g_tdm_settings "fraglimit: 200"


// This example shows you how to set up an extremely long map rotation by using
// multiple cvars. If the very last character in "sv_extmaplist" is an ampersand (&),
// then the mod will read the cvar named "sv_extmaplist1" and add that to the end of
// "sv_extmaplist". If "sv_extmaplist1" also has an "&" at the end of it, then it
// will add "sv_extmaplist2" to the end of it. You can continue "chaining" cvars like
// this up to a maximum of 999 cvars.
//
// You can also "chain" the settings cvars (g_mef_settings, g_ctf_settings,
// g_ft_settings, etc...). This is useful if you are changing a lot of settings.
//
// In this example we first play maps dm1 through dm7 in Free-For-All mode. After that,
// the same set of dm maps are played in Team-Match mode. Then we switch to the obj maps
// and play those in Objective-Match mode. Finally, we play the same set of obj maps in
// Freeze-Tag-Objective mode.
//
set sv_extmaplist  "dm/mohdm1,ffa dm/mohdm2 dm/mohdm3 dm/mohdm4 dm/mohdm6 dm/mohdm7 &"
set sv_extmaplist1 "dm/mohdm1,tdm dm/mohdm2 dm/mohdm3 dm/mohdm4 dm/mohdm6 dm/mohdm7 &"
set sv_extmaplist2 "obj/obj_team1,obj obj/obj_team2 obj/obj_team3 obj/obj_team4 &"
set sv_extmaplist3 "obj/obj_team1,ftobj obj/obj_team2 obj/obj_team3 obj/obj_team4"


// It is also possible to have individual gametype settings for each entry in your map
// rotation. See the next example config (mixed-types-extmaplist_3.cfg).


// Set g_gametype to the appropriate value for the first map in the rotation.
// It should be 3 if the first map is a dm, tow, or lib map.
// It should be 4 if the first map is an obj map.
set g_gametype 3


// load the first map
map dm/mohdm1
