// Sample server config #3 for using the new "sv_extmaplist" cvar
// This is not your entire server.cfg, only the part that is relevant
// to running mixed gametypes. You should copy and paste this to the end
// of your server.cfg.


// These cvars control the settings for each gametype. For a detailed explanation
// see the "mixed-types-extmaplist_1.cfg" file and also the readme file.
//
set g_mef_settings "timelimit: 30 fraglimit: 5"
set g_ffa_settings "fraglimit: 50"
set g_tdm_settings "fraglimit: 200"


// This example shows you how to define settings for individual entries in your map
// rotation. If an entry begins with a dollar-sign ($), then the rest of that entry
// is the name of a cvar to be read. This cvar then contains the actual map name for
// that entry, the gametype to be played, and then any gametype settings that should
// apply just for that entry in the rotation.
//
// In this example the cvar "map1" contains the settings for a low gravity, high runspeed
// game of CTF on dm/mohdm1. "map2" contains the settings for a freeze tag game on the same
// map with the gravity and runspeed restored to normal. Each entry also defines its own
// timelimit that is different from the default of 30 that was set in "g_mef_settings".
//
// Note that you can set any cvar in your list of settings by using the "cvar:" keyword.
// This should be followed by the name of the cvar you want to set and then the value to
// set it to. Keep in mind that if you set cvars in your rotation then they will stay
// active for the rest of the maps in the rotation. You will need to restore them back
// to normal like this example shows if you don't want them to affect the rest of the maps.
//
// The actual maplist consists of low-grav CTF on dm1, then FT on dm1, then FFA on
// dm3, then another round of FT on dm1, and finally TDM on dm4.
//
set map1 "dm/mohdm1 ctf pointlimit: 7 timelimit: 15 cvar: sv_gravity 100 cvar: sv_runspeed 500"
set map2 "dm/mohdm1 ft timelimit: 20 cvar: sv_gravity 800 cvar: sv_runspeed 250"
set sv_extmaplist "$map1 $map2 dm/mohdm3,ffa $map2 dm/mohdm4,tdm"


// Set g_gametype to the appropriate value for the first map in the rotation.
// It should be 3 if the first map is a dm, tow, or lib map.
// It should be 4 if the first map is an obj map.
set g_gametype 3


// load the first map
map dm/mohdm1
