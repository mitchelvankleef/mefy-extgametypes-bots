// Sample server config for Capture-The-Flag
// This is not your entire server.cfg, only the part that is relevant
// to running CTF. You should copy and paste this to the end
// of your server.cfg.

// set g_gametype to 3 if the first map in the rotation is a dm, tow, or lib map
// set g_gametype to 4 if the first map in the rotation is an obj map
set g_gametype 3

// this activates Capture-The-Flag
set g_extgametype ctf

// CTF settings are controlled through the "g_ctf_settings" cvar.
// The commented line below is just an example of how it works.
// See the readme file for the complete list of settings for this gametype.
//
// set g_ctf_settings "respawn: 0 returnboth: 1 capturepress: -1"

// the map rotation (all dm maps)
// CTF is supported on all stock maps
set sv_maplist "dm/mohdm1 dm/mohdm2 dm/mohdm3 dm/mohdm4 dm/mohdm5 dm/mohdm6 dm/mohdm7"

// load the first map
