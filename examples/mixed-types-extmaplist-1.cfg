// Sample server config #1 for using the new "sv_extmaplist" cvar
// This is not your entire server.cfg, only the part that is relevant
// to running mixed gametypes. You should copy and paste this to the end
// of your server.cfg.


// You can use the generic "g_mef_settings" for setting common gametype
// settings, such as "timelimit", "roundlimit", or "mef_team_spawn_interval".
// You can also put the general freeze tag related settings in here so that
// they affect all freeze tag based gametypes, or the ctf settings so they
// would affect both CTF and FTCTF.
//
// This example sets the timelimit to 30 and fraglimit to 5 for all gametypes.
//
set g_mef_settings "timelimit: 30 fraglimit: 5"


// You will want to use the "g_<gametype>_settings" cvars to control the
// settings for each specific gametype. Whatever you set in these ones will
// override what you have set in "g_mef_settings". See the readme file for
// the complete list of settings available for each gametype.
//
// In this example the fraglimit needs to be set to 50 for FFA and 200 for TDM.
//
set g_ffa_settings "fraglimit: 50"
set g_tdm_settings "fraglimit: 200"


// This defines the map rotation. This works the same as "sv_maplist" except that
// each map name can be followed by a gametype to be played on that map. You must
// use a comma (,) to separate the map name and gametype. If a map name has no
// gametype associated with it, then it will run whatever gametype that was set
// from the previous map.
//
// In this example we will play Free-For-All on dm1, dm7, and dm2, then switch to
// Freeze-Tag on dm4, then Demolition on dm6, then switch to Team-Match for dm1,
// dm2, and dm3.
//
set sv_extmaplist "dm/mohdm1,ffa dm/mohdm7 dm/mohdm2 dm/mohdm4,ft dm/mohdm6,dem dm/mohdm1,tdm dm/mohdm2 dm/mohdm3"


// If you have an extremely long maplist then you can break it up into multiple cvars.
// See the next example config (mixed-types-extmaplist_2.cfg) to see how this works.


// Set g_gametype to the appropriate value for the first map in the rotation.
// It should be 3 if the first map is a dm, tow, or lib map.
// It should be 4 if the first map is an obj map.
set g_gametype 3


// load the first map
map dm/mohdm1
