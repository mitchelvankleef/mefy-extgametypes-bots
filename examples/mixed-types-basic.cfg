// Sample server config for Basic Mixed Gametypes (Allied Assault)
// This is not your entire server.cfg, only the part that is relevant
// to running mixed gametypes. You should copy and paste this to the end
// of your server.cfg.
//
// NOTE: This kind of config will only let you play one gametype per map.
// You won't be able to have a rotation where you have the same map but
// different gametypes (for example tdm on dm/mohdm1 and then ctf on dm/mohdm1
// later on). See the "mixed-types-extmaplist-1.cfg" example config for doing
// this type of rotation.

// The annoying side effects that previously affected this kind of config
// are no longer present. You can now mix gametypes freely!


// You can use the generic "g_mef_settings" for setting common gametype
// settings, such as "timelimit", "roundlimit", or "mef_team_spawn_interval".
// You can also put the general freeze tag related settings in here so that
// they affect all freeze tag based gametypes, or the ctf settings so they
// would affect both CTF and FTCTF.
//
// This example sets the timelimit to 30 and fraglimit to 5 for all gametypes.
//
set g_mef_settings "timelimit: 30 fraglimit: 5"


// You will want to use the "g_<gametype>_settings" cvars to control the
// settings for each specific gametype. Whatever you set in these ones will
// override what you have set in "g_mef_settings". See the readme file for
// the complete list of settings available for each gametype.
//
// In this example the fraglimit needs to be set to 50 for FFA and 200 for TDM.
//
set g_ffa_settings "fraglimit: 50"
set g_tdm_settings "fraglimit: 200"


// These set the gametype for each map in your rotation.
//
// NOTE that the name of the "g_extgametype_<mapname>" cvar does NOT include the
// obj/, dm/, or /lib prefix! For example, the gametype cvar for the map
// "obj/mp_druckkammern_tow" would be "g_extgametype_mp_druckkammern_tow".
//
set g_extgametype_mohdm1 ffa      // Free-For-All for Southern France
set g_extgametype_mohdm2 tdm      // Team-Match on Destroyed Village
set g_extgametype_mohdm3 ft       // Freeze-Tag on Remagen
set g_extgametype_mohdm4 ft       // Freeze-Tag on Crossroads
set g_extgametype_mohdm5 rbm      // Round-Based-Match on Snowy Park
set g_extgametype_mohdm6 dem      // Demolition on Stalingrad
set g_extgametype_mohdm7 ctf      // Capture-The-Flag on Algiers
set g_extgametype_obj_team1 ftobj // Freeze-Tag-Objective on The Hunt
set g_extgametype_obj_team2 obj   // Objective-Match on V2 Rocket Facility
set g_extgametype_obj_team3 ctf   // Capture-The-Flag on Omaha Beach
set g_extgametype_obj_team4 ftobj // Freeze-Tag-Objective on The Bridge


// the map rotation (all allied assault maps)
set sv_maplist "dm/mohdm1 dm/mohdm2 dm/mohdm3 dm/mohdm4 dm/mohdm5 dm/mohdm6 dm/mohdm7 obj/obj_team1 obj/obj_team2 obj/obj_team3 obj/obj_team4"


// Set g_gametype to the appropriate value for the first map in the rotation.
// It should be 3 if the first map is a dm, tow, or lib map.
// It should be 4 if the first map is an obj map.
//
set g_gametype 3


// Make sure that g_extgametype is blank. If it is set then it will override
// all of the map specific gametypes.
//
set g_extgametype ""


// load the first map
